# Tomato Plant Dieases Predictor
The "Tomato Plant Diseases Predictor" is an innovative project leveraging TensorFlow, a robust machine learning framework, to detect diseases and pests affecting tomato plants using image recognition. This predictor utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), a specialized deep learning model for image classification, trained on a dataset containing images of healthy tomato plants and those with various diseases. Through training, the CNN learns to identify patterns and features in the images corresponding to different diseases, enabling it to predict the likelihood of a tomato plant being affected by a particular disease based on an input image.

Graphs in the accompanying model.ipynb illustrate the training and validation performance of the machine learning model, likely a CNN trained with TensorFlow. The left graph demonstrates accuracy, with the y-axis representing accuracy and the x-axis representing epochs or iterations over the training data. The blue line signifies training accuracy, showing the model's performance on the training data after each epoch. The orange line represents validation accuracy, indicating the model's performance on a separate validation set not used for training. Similarly, the right graph shows loss, with the y-axis representing loss and the x-axis representing epochs. The blue line depicts training loss, indicating the model's loss on the training data after each epoch, while the orange line represents validation loss, showing the model's loss on the validation data. These graphs are vital for assessing the model's learning and generalization to unseen data, aiding in optimizing its performance.

The model is capable of identifying various common tomato plant issues, such as mosaic virus, Septoria leaf spot, early blight, yellow leaf curl virus, late blight, and two-spotted spider mites, with high confidence levels. For instance, in sample images, the model achieved confidence levels exceeding 99.9% for Septoria leaf spot and 99.74% for late blight. Such a tool is invaluable for farmers and gardeners, as it enables early detection and intervention to protect tomato crops, ultimately reducing crop losses.
