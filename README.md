# Tomato Plant Dieases Predictor
The "Tomato Plant Diseases Predictor" is a project that uses TensorFlow to detect diseases in tomato plants. TensorFlow is a powerful machine learning framework that can be used for image recognition tasks, making it well-suited for this project.

To create the predictor, you would likely use a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification. The CNN would be trained on a dataset of images of healthy tomato plants as well as images of tomato plants with various diseases.

During training, the CNN learns to recognize patterns and features in the images that correspond to different diseases. Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to predict the likelihood of a tomato plant having a particular disease based on an input image.

This type of project can be incredibly valuable for farmers and agriculturalists, as early detection of diseases can help prevent the spread of disease and reduce crop losses.
